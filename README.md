The goal of `xpose.nlmixr` is to provide an extension to `xpose` to support `nlmixr`. The package provides functions to import `nlmixr` fit data into an `xpose` data object, allowing the use of `xpose` for `nlmixr` model diagnostics.  
The excellent `xpose` package can be found [here](https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/xpose), and is a prerequisite for using `xpose.nlmixr`.

## Installation

```

Alternatively, the development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/xpose.nlmixr):
